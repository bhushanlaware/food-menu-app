# Food Menu App

## Overview
This project is a React-based Food Menu landing page created as a technical assessment. The application features a header with a logo and search bar, a filter section, a food items section, and a footer. It uses the [TheMealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) to fetch food data and mimics the design and theme of [Swiggy](https://www.swiggy.com/).

## Features
- **Header Section**: Contains a logo and a non-functional search bar.
- **Filters Section**: Allows users to filter food items by area and sort them alphabetically.
- **Food Items Section**: Displays food items with images, names, and random ratings. Clicking on a food item opens a modal with more details.
- **Footer Section**: Simple footer to balance the page.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive and works well on various screen sizes.
